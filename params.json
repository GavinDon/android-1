Kotlin to Java is like C++ to C.  \r\nKotlin libraries used in this project:\r\n\r\n* Anko - A DSL for layout and extension methods for Android development, Written  by JetBrains.\r\n* Kodein - Dependency Injection library, based on Kotlin's delegation support.\r\n* Fuel - The easiest HTTP networking library in Kotlin for Android.\r\n* KotPref - Android SharedPreference delegation for Kotlin.\r\n\r\n## Vector images\r\nMost of the app's images are vector graphics.  \r\n> Vector graphics is the use of geometrical primitives such as points, lines, curves, and shapes or polygons—all of which are based on mathematical expressions—to represent images in computer graphics \r\n\r\nVector graphics allow the app to look perfect on any screen resolution, including QHD and 4K. (Tested on G4 with QHD screen).\r\n\r\nSome of the icons were taken from those icon sets.
